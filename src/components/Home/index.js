          My career started in video production. I have worked in everything from directing, producing,
          video editing (both live and post-production), producing and so much more! One of my favorite
          moments involved producing early coverage for the <a href="https://www.theopen.com/" target="_blank" rel='noreferrer'>2019 The Open</a>.

          Around the time of the pandemic, I rediscovered my love of coding, and enrolled in University
          of Central Floridaâ€™s Coding Bootcamp, finishing in June of 2021.

          I started working for Proforma in August of 2021. While initially hired as a Full Stack Web
          Developer, I transitioned to the QA Automation team, due to unplanned job vacancies.
          However, my passion and focus remain with Full Stack Development.

        <p class="flow-text">
          In my time here, I have risen to Team Lead of QA Automation. Due to my focus on efficiency
          and consistency I was tasked with planning and developing the transition of our MS testing
          framework to Xunit.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
          While I have enjoyed my time in QA Automation, I am looking for a role that allows me to flex
          my Full Stack muscles. I look forward to meeting you!
